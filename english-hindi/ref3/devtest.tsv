As precise and stable space-qualified atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple redundancy keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space.	चूंकि सटीक और स्थिर स्पेस-योग्य ऑटोमिक क्लॉक किसी भी सेटेलाईट – नेविगेशन सिस्टम के लिए महत्वपूर्ण घटक है, इसलिए अंतरिक्ष में ऑनबोर्ड ऑटोमिक क्लॉक के विफल होने पर नियोजित क्वाड्रूपल रिडंडन्सी गैलीलियो को कार्यशील रखता है  ।
The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10−9 or 1 / 1, 000, 000, 000 second) translates into a 30 centimetres (12 in) positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate the time that it takes the signal to reach it.	ऑनबोर्ड पैसिव हाइड्रोजन मेसर क्लॉक की सटीकता ऑनबोर्ड रूबिडियम आटोमिक क्लॉक से चारगुणा बेहतर है और एक सेकण्ड प्रति 3 मिलियन वर्ष(नैनो सेकण्ड की समय त्रूटीया या सेकण्ड का एक  बिलियनवां (10-9 या 1/1,000,000,000 सेकण्ड) जो पृथ्वी की सतह पर 30 सेंटिमीटर (12 इन) स्थितीय त्रुटि में परिवर्तित होता है) अनुमानित है और यह सटीक समय सिग्नल प्रदान करता है जिससे रिसीवर सिग्नल को यहां तक पंहुचने में लगने समय को आंक सके ।

Thus, on the whole it seems likely that the traditional Sanskritist view, that the poet of the Śatakatraya is the same as the grammarian Bhartṛhari, may be accepted.	इसी लिए कुल मिलाकर यह लगता है कि शायद पारंपरिक संस्कृतिक दृष्टि, कि शतकत्रय के कवि और ग्रामेरियन भर्तृहरि एक ही है, को स्वीकार किया जा सकता है ।
